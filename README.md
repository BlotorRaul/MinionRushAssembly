# Project Description: Minion Rush in Assembly

## Overview:
The "Minion Rush" project is a simplified representation in assembly language of the popular game "Minion Rush". In this game, a character (minion) must avoid obstacles and collect other objects to accumulate points.

## Key Features:
- **Canvas Graphic Interface:** The game utilizes a canvas to display graphics and interact with the player.
- **Character Control:** The player can control the movement of the character (minion) using arrow keys.
- **Obstacles and Collectible Elements:** Throughout the game, the minion must dodge obstacles and collect other objects to gain points.
- **Scoring System:** The game keeps track of the player's score, increasing it based on the collected objects and the distance traveled.

## Implementation:
- **Graphics and User Interface:** Graphics and user interaction are implemented using drawing and mouse or keyboard interaction functionalities provided by the canvas.
- **Collision Detection:** Collision detection between the minion and obstacles, or between the minion and collectible objects, is achieved using simple algorithms for detecting coordinate overlaps.
- **Score Calculation:** The player's score is calculated based on the collected objects and the distance traveled by the minion.

## Requirements:
- **Platform:** The project is intended to run on an emulator of a processor compatible with assembly language, supporting graphics drawing and user interaction through canvas.
- **Assembly Language Knowledge:** A good understanding of assembly language and graphics and user interaction concepts is required to efficiently and correctly implement the game.
- **Creativity and Attention to Detail:** Implementing the game requires creativity in designing obstacles and collectible objects, as well as attention to detail in managing collisions and scoring.

## Conclusion:
The "Minion Rush" project in assembly is an interesting and fun challenge for anyone looking to test their skills in assembly language and create a simple and interactive representation of a popular game.
